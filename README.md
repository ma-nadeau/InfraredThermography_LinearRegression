1. Navigate to the `InfraredThermographyTemperature` folder.
2. Run the `PrepareAndTestDataset.py` file.

## Dataset
- `InfraredThermographyTemperature/Data`: Contains the data for linear regression.

## Results
Any resulting figures/graphs will be saved in the following folders:
- `InfraredThermographyTemperature/Results`: Contains the results for linear regression.

## Helper Functions
The `Helper.py` and `PlotHelpers.py` file contains all the helper functions used throughout this project.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
